# apartmint-bootstrap

Apartmint is app to help connect landlords and renters in a quick and convenient way.

The way this app works is a one click user application to an apartment that a landlord/property manager makes available

Each user (whether a landlord or potential tenant) registers with their background information through the app registration portal

The tenant user browses the property they are looking for in the listings page.  Upon spotting the property, the tenant (applicant) uses one click to apply for the unit which pushes their registered profile to the unit's property manager.  

Each request from a tenant goes directly to that property managers request page and is json'd into a list with all the tenant user's background information stored in their profile as a card with an accept or reject button.  The property manager can then decide whether or not the applicant (potential tenant) is fit to rent the unit out to. 

On click of accept the applicant gets an accepted card with full details of when to pick up keys and other pertanent details.
